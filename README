mosquitto message database 
--------------------------
This project allows MQTT messages to be saved to a key/value database.
Keys take the form of the MQTT topic followed by an '@' symbol and
finally a unix timestamp. Example:

b1a5d81be9b6/pump/status@1687502049

The value is the MQTT message payload.

The key/value database is currently btree(3), I may upgrade to redis or
similar when the time comes.

I have included a program to read the database file and print out all 
the values in csv format, it is named 'read_db.c'. This is mainly for
debugging.

Requirements
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (the .so is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install the .so (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running
-------
Edit mosquitto.conf(5) and add a plugin directive matching your setup
(the default plugin file path is 
/usr/local/lib/mosquitto/mosquitto_msg_db.so). Example:

		plugin /usr/local/lib/mosquitto/mosquitto_msg_db.so

Afterwards you will need to restart the broker, on OpenBSD you would
run the command (if necessary as root):

		rcctl restart mosquitto
